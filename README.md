# Title:  Grampanchayat Tax Management System  

## Overview  
In an age of technological advancement, many Grampanchayats continue to rely on traditional, manual methods for managing tax collection. 
This approach involves pen-and-paper record-keeping, which is time-consuming, prone to errors, and difficult to maintain or analyze over time.  

This project addresses the issue faced by the employees of **Karde Grampanchayat**, who requested an automated system to streamline their tax collection 
and management processes. The result is the **Grampanchayat Tax Management System** a user-friendly website designed to meet their requirements of streamline
